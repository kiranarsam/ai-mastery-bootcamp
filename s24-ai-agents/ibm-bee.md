# IBM's Bee Agent Framework
IBM's Bee Agent Framework is an open-source platform developed to build and manage scalable AI Agents and workflows. It allows developers to create agents that leverage various large langauge models (LLMs) and tools to handle complex tasks in an efficent and structured manner.
The framework is desinged to be model-agnostic, meaning it supports different AI models and is not tied to any specific provider, helping developers avoid vendor lock-in.
